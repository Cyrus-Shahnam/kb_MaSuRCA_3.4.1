#example configuration file for rhodobacter sphaeroides assembly from GAGE project (http://gage.cbcb.umd.edu)
#DATA is specified as type {PE,JUMP,OTHER}= two_letter_prefix mean stdev fastq(.gz)_fwd_reads fastq(.gz)_rev_reads
#NOTE that PE reads are always assumed to be innies, i.e. ---> <---,
#and JUMP are assumed to be outties <--- --->; if there are any jump
#libraries that are innies, such as longjump, specify them as JUMP and
#specify NEGATIVE mean
#IT IS MANDATORY to supply some Illumina paired end or single end reads
#reverse (R2) reads are optional for PE libraries and mandatory forJUMP libraries
#any OTHER sequence data (454, Sanger, Ion torrent, etc) must be first
#converted into Celera Assembler compatible .frg files (see http://wgsassembler.sourceforge.com)
#and supplied as OTHER=file.frg; 
#PACBIO reads must be in a single FASTA file and supplied as PACBIO=reads.fa;
#NANOPORE reads must be in a single FASTA file and supplied as
#NANOPORE=reads.fa

PARAMETERS
#this is k-mer size for deBruijn graph values between 25 and 101 are
#supported, auto will compute the optimal size based on the read data
#and GC content. Do not set this longer than PE read length!!!
GRAPH_KMER_SIZE=auto
#set this to 1 for all Illumina-only assemblies
#set this to 1 if you have less than 20x long reads (454, Sanger,
#Pacbio) and less than 50x CLONE coverage by Illumina, Sanger or 454 mate pairs
#otherwise keep at 0
USE_LINKING_MATES=1
#this parameter is useful if you have too many jumping library mates.
#Typically set it to 60 for bacteria and something large (300) for mammals
LIMIT_JUMP_COVERAGE = 60
#these are the additional parameters to Celera Assembler. do not
#worry about performance, number or processors or batch sizes -- these
#are computed automatically. for mammalian genomes do not set cgwErrorRate above 0.15!!! 
#set cgwErrorRate=0.25 for bacteria
CA_PARAMETERS = cgwErrorRate=0.15
# number of cpus to use
NUM_THREADS= 64
#this is mandatory jellyfish hash size â€“ 10x the genome size is a good starting value
JF_SIZE=100000000
#this specifies if we do (1) or do not (0) want to trim long runs of
#homopolymers (e.g. GGGGGGGG) from 3' read ends, use it for high GC genomes
DO_HOMOPOLYMER_TRIM=0
