            The standard deviation for defining the jump reads in the config.txt file.
    pacbio_reads :
        ui-name : PacBio Reads
        short-hint : PacBio OR NanoPore reads must be in a single fasta or fastq file with absolute path; can be gzipped. If you have both types of reads supply them both as NANOPORE type. Supports KBaseAssembly.SingleEndLibrary, KBaseFile.SingleEndLibrary, KBaseAssembly.PairedEndLibrary, and KBaseFile.PairedEndLibrary.
    nanopore_reads :
        ui-name : NanoPore Reads
        short-hint : PacBio OR NanoPore reads must be in a single fasta or fastq file with absolute path; can be gzipped. If you have both types of reads supply them both as NANOPORE type. Supports KBaseAssembly.SingleEndLibrary, KBaseFile.SingleEndLibrary, KBaseAssembly.PairedEndLibrary, and KBaseFile.PairedEndLibrary.
    other_frg_file:
        ui-name : Other FRG
        short-hint : Must have been converted into a Celera Assembler compatible .frg file. Other reads (Sanger, 454, etc) one frg file, concatenate your frg files into one if you have many.
    jf_size :
        ui-name : Jellyfish Size<
        short-hint : |
            An integer for the mandatory jellyfish hash size.
    output_contigset_name :
        ui-name : |
            Output ContigSet Name
        short-hint : |
            The name for the resulting ContigSet that will be saved in KBase.
    graph_kmer_size :
        ui-name : |
            Graph K-mer Size
        short-hint : |
            The k-mer size to be used for super reads. This is k-mer size for deBruijn graph (values between 25 and 127 are supported). Auto will compute the optimal size based on the read data and GC content.
    use_linking_mates :
        ui-name : |
            Use Linking Mates
        short-hint : |
            Those that do not end up in the same super read are called 'linking mates.' Check this for all Illumina-only assemblies. Uncheck if you have more than 15x coverage by long reads (Pacbio or Nanopore) or any other long reads/mate pairs (Illumina MP, Sanger, 454, etc).
    dna_source :
        ui-name : |
            DNA Source
        short-hint : |
            Bacteria or other organisms. This parameter is useful if you have too many Illumina jumping library mates. It decides to set the limit_jump_coverage to 60 for bacteria and 300 for the other organisms and the cgwErrorRate to 0.25 for bacteria and 0.15 for the other organisms.
    kmer_count_threshold :
        ui-name : |
            K-mer Count Threshold
        short-hint : |
            The minimum count k-mers used in error correction. 1 means all k-mers are used. Users can increase to 2 if coverage >100. MaSuRCA works best with coverage up to 150x. To use 200x+ coverage data, you need to set KMER_COUNT_THRESHOLD parameter in the config file to 2 or 3, or simply use part of the data.
    close_gaps :
        ui-name : |
            Close Gaps
        short-hint : |
            Whether to attempt to close gaps in scaffolds with Illumina data (1) or not (0).
    soap_assembly :
        ui-name : |
            Soap Assembly
        short-hint : |
            Set this to 1 to use SOAPdenovo contigging/scaffolding module. The assembly will be worse, but it will run faster. Useful for very large (>5Gbp) genomes from Illumina-only data.
    do_homopolymer_trim :
        ui-name : |
            Do Homopolymer Trim
        short-hint : |
            Specifies whether the user does (1) or does not (0) want to trim long runs of homopolymers (e.g. GGGGGGGG) from the 3’ read ends. Use it for high GC genomes.

parameter-groups :
    reads_libraries :
        ui-name : |
            Reads Libraries
        short-hint : |
            The reads libraries to be assembled.
    jump_libraries :
        ui-name : |
            Jump Reads
        short-hint : |
            The jump reads to be assembled.

    <p>This is a KBase wrapper for <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/29/21/2669/195975/The-MaSuRCA-genome-assembler">MaSuRCA (Maryland Super Read Cabog Assembler).</a> The MaSuRCA assembler combines the benefits of deBruijn graph and Overlap-Layout-Consensus assembly approaches. Since version 3.2.1, it supports hybrid assembly with short Illumina reads and long high error PacBio/MinION data.</p>

    <p>MaSuRCA uses long reads with higher error rates combined with relatively shorter reads with lower error rates to create *mega-reads*, which are them assembled. MaSuRCA extends Illumina reads into *super-reads*, and then aligns the super-reads with PacBio reads to create the mega-reads. The assembly calls for at least 10x coverage of PacBio reads and 100x coverage of Illumina reads.</p>

    <p>DATA is specified as type {PE,JUMP,OTHER,PACBIO} and 5 fields:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>two_letter_prefix</li>
        <li>mean</li>
        <li>stdev</li>
        <li>fastq(.gz)_fwd_reads</li>
        <li>fastq(.gz)_rev_reads<li>
    </ul>

    <p>The PE reads are always assumed to be innies, i.e. --->.<---, and JUMP are assumed to be outties <---.--->. If there are any jump libraries that are innies, such as longjump, specify them as JUMP and specify NEGATIVE mean. Reverse reads are optional for PE libraries and mandatory for JUMP libraries. Any OTHER sequence data (454, Sanger, Ion torrent, etc) must be first converted into Celera Assembler compatible .frg files (see http://wgs-assembler.sourceforge.com)</p>
