        long_hint: |
            <p>Other reads (Sanger, 454, etc) one frg file, concatenate your frg files into one if you have many</p>
    jf_size :
        ui-name : jellyfish_size<font color=red>*</font>
        short-hint : |
            An integer for the mandatory jellyfish hash size
    output_contigset_name :
        ui-name : |
            Output ContigSet Name<font color=red>*</font>
        short-hint : |
            The name for the resulting ContigSet will be saved in KBase
    graph_kmer_size :
        ui-name : |
            graph_kmer_size
        short-hint : |
            kmer size to be used for super reads
        long-hint: |
            <p>this is k-mer size for deBruijn graph values between 25 and 127 are supported, auto will compute the optimal size based on the read data and GC content</p>
    use_linking_mates :
        ui-name : |
            use_linking_mates
        short-hint : |
            Those that do not end up in the same super read are called 'linking mates'
        long-hint: |
            <p>Check this for all Illumina-only assemblies; uncheck if you have more than 15x coverage by long reads (Pacbio or Nanopore) or any other long reads/mate pairs (Illumina MP, Sanger, 454, etc)</p>
    limit_jump_coverage :
        ui-name : |
            limit_jump_coverage
        short-hint : |
             set this parameter to have assembler down-sample the jumping library to 60x (from above) coverage
        long-hint: |
            <p>This parameter is useful if you have too many Illumina jumping library mates. Typically set it to 60 for bacteria and 300 for the other organisms</p>
    cgwErrorRate :
        ui-name : |
            cgwErrorRate
        short-hint : |
            additional parameters to Celera Assembler
        long-hint: |
            <p>Set cgwErrorRate=0.25 for bacteria and 0.1<=cgwErrorRate<=0.15 for other organisms.</p>
    kmer_count_threshold :
        ui-name : |
            kmer_count_threshold
        short-hint : |
            minimum count k-mers used in error correction 1 means all k-mers are used. one can increase to 2 if coverage >100
        long-hint : |
            <p>MaSuRCA works best with coverage up to 150x. To use 200x+ coverage data you need to set KMER_COUNT_THRESHOLD parameter in the config file to 2 or 3, or simply use part of the data.</p>
    close_gaps :
        ui-name : |
            close_gaps
        short-hint : |
            whether to attempt to close gaps in scaffolds with Illumina data (1) or not (0)
    soap_assembly :
        ui-name : |
            soap_assembly
        short-hint : |
            <p>set this to 1 to use SOAPdenovo contigging/scaffolding module.  Assembly will be worse but will run faster. Useful for very large (>5Gbp) genomes from Illumina-only data</p>
    do_homopolymer_trim :
        ui-name : |
            do_homopolymer_trim
        short-hint : |
            <p>specifies if we do (1) or do not (0) want to trim long runs of homopolymers (e.g. GGGGGGGG) from 3 prime read ends, use it for high GC genomes DO_HOMOPOLYMER_TRIM=0</p>

parameter-groups :
    reads_libraries :
        ui-name : |
            Reads libraries to be assembled<font color=red>*</font>

        long-hint  : |
