# kb_MaSuRCA
---

A [KBase](https://kbase.us) module generated by the [KBase SDK](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk).


This Module was initialized with a generated example App.  To compile and run the
example App implementation, run:

    cd kb_MaSuRCA
    make          (required after making changes to $module_name.spec)
    kb-sdk test   (will require setting test user account credentials in test_local/test.cfg)

General steps to run the MaSuRCA assemblers:

    First, create a configuration file which contains the location of the compiled assembler (the 
    executable), data and assembly parameters. 
    
    (The config file consists of two sections: DATA and PARAMETERS. Each section concludes with END statement. 
    User should copy the sample config file to the directory of choice for running the assembly and 
    then modify it according to the specifications of the assembly project.)
    
    Second, run the 'masurca' script which will generate from the configuration file a shell script
    'assemble.sh', which is the main driver of the assembly.

    Finally, run the script 'assemble.sh' to assemble the data.
