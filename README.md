General steps to run the MaSuRCA assemblers:


    First, create a configuration file which contains the location of the compiled assembler (the 
    executable), data and assembly parameters. 
    
    (The config file consists of two sections: DATA and PARAMETERS. Each section concludes with END statement. 
    User should copy the sample config file to the directory of choice for running the assembly and 
    then modify it according to the specifications of the assembly project.)
    
    Second, run the 'masurca' script which will generate from the configuration file a shell script
    'assemble.sh', which is the main driver of the assembly.
    
    (Once you’ve created a configuration file, use the ‘masurca' script from the MaSuRCA bin directory 
    to generate the 'assemble.sh' shell script that executes the assembly:
        $ /install_path/ MaSuRCA-X.X.X/bin/masurca config.txt)

    Finally, execute the script 'assemble.sh' to assemble the data.
