# kb_MaSuRCA
---

A [KBase](https://kbase.us) module generated by the [KBase SDK](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk).


This Module was initialized with a generated example App.  To compile and run the
example App implementation, run:

    cd kb_MaSuRCA
    make          (required after making changes to $module_name.spec)
    kb-sdk test   (will require setting test user account credentials in test_local/test.cfg)

General steps to run the MaSuRCA assemblers:

    First, create a configuration file which contains the location of the compiled assembler, the
    location of the data and some parameters. Copy in your assembly directory the template
    configuration file '/install_path/sr_config_example.txt' which was created by the installer with
    the correct paths to the freshly compiled software and with reasonable parameters. Many
    assembly projects should only need to set the path to the input data.

    Second, run the 'masurca' script which will generate from the configuration file a shell script
    'assemble.sh'. This last script is the main driver of the assembly.

    Finally, run the script 'assemble.sh' to assemble the data.
